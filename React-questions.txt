10. virtual dom and real dom ?

=> virtual dom is a clone of real dom, when some thing got change to virtual dom, virtual dom compare itself with real dom and change that content only of program.

11. features of react ?

=> 1. it is single page application which make itself fast.
   2. it is use single directional data flow model.
   3. it uses virtual dom to manipulate data.

12. Jsx 

=> it is a javascript with html, react uses it because it make easy to write html with javascript.

13. disadvantages of react ?

=>  1. react has complex structure of write the code so that beginner will face difficulty to 
       understand its structure.
    2. react is simple library and not complete framework hence it call for dependencies. 

14. what is npm ?

=>  npm is the node package manager which is open source package and it contains over 8 lacks code 
    packages. if some develeper wants that code developer can install that pachage by npm install 
    package name.

    details of project like dependencied if we delete package.json file it is about impossible to get 
    all details about the project to new developer.

17. what is life-cycle method?
    Basically LifeCyle Methods are usually used in Class Based Components, there are mainly many 
    LifeCycle Mathods called 1) Constructor 2) componentDidMount 3) componentDidUpdate 
    4) shouldComponentUpdate 5)willComponentUpdate.

 
18. angular is also single page application. why do we use react in place of angular

    i) React is focussed only on UI Development, if need some extra feature then we should get extra 
       library
    ii) Angular has many more built in functionality, Using of Angular means we have built more feature
        than We need which we don't want, It means we should use React when we need Limited functionality.
    iii) Angular uses TypeScript where React uses JavaScript
    iv) When we use Angular it means we are using typescript which gets converted into javascript.
    v) Vue has more feature then react and less than Angular.
    
19. What is High Order Component ?
    
    A Component which takes Component as an Input and give Component as an OutPut .


20. What is difference between Class based and Functional Based Component?
    1)Class Based Component has LifeCycle Method whereas Functional Based Component used Hooks  
    2)Class Based has render method but Functional Based doesn't has.
    3)Constructor function is available is class Component but not present in Functional Based Component.

21) What is useMemo?
    useMemo is a hook which return memoized value means value which is present in useMemo does not 
    need to be recalculated.

22) what is useRef?
    useRef is a hook which used for uncontrolled component. to get the input data from uncontrolled 
    component.

23) what is Controlled and Uncontrolled Component?
    Component which controlled by react is called Controlled Component and Uncontrolled Component is 
    component whose input field is controlled by ref or javascript not by state in react.
 
24) what is useContext?
    it is a hook, normally if we want data into other component other than component in which data is 
    defined, we have to use prop drilling method in which we need to pass the data into middle 
    components but using of useContext allow us to pass the data only in two above components.

25) what is useReducer?
    it is a hook, which helps to manage the state, it consist two parameter which are first reducer 
    function and initial state. Here reducer function is pure function where we define what action we 
    need to perform. useReducer hook is equal to arrar destructring in which we have two element, first
    is current state and second is dispatch. here dispatch contain action. as per action reducer 
    function is defined. 

26) what is redux?
    redux is a state management tool which uses Reducer function  to manipulate the state.

27) what is Redux LifeCyle?
    redux lifecycle consis of a action in which we get what action we have to perform and a reducer in 
    which actions are defined like how action we need to perform then last is a store where the state 
    got save. and using of provider method by which all state will get access to all the state. 
    Provider is defined by attribute called as store which is equal to redux's store. we also have
    useDispatch hook in which we pass the action and a hook called useSelector to get the data from 
    redux's store.

28) what is React-Icons?
    React Icons is also a library which consist os Icons.

29) what is useEffect?
    useEffect is a hook which call itself on redering, it consist of dependencies array which contain 
    an array of single element which is variable from useState. By this when the variable got changed 
    useEffect will call. 

30) what is pure function ?
    pure function is function which doesn't give any side-effect to component and give the exact output
    according to input.

31) Pure Component?
    Pure Component like a useMemo in Functional Component. Pure Component is similar to Regular 
    Component but only difference is it doesn't call shouldComponentUpdate method if the state is same 
    as Previous State. It doesn't render the component.

32) Wrapper Component?
    react component only return single element so to wrap the all element, wrapper component is used.

33) Use of High Order Component?
    To add new feature in specified component.


34) Statless and stateful component?
    Stateless component are those component whose data is not manipulated using of useState in 
    component as their data can be manipulate by Redux or Context API but stateful component are those
    whose data can be manipulate using useState.


35) what is useCallback? 
    useCallback hook is like a usememo but only difference is memo allow us to not re-render the 
    memoized value where useCallback allow us to not re-render memoized funtion and memoized value 
    means sometime we do know the output it waas previous one but react.js re-render itself and value 
    stored in cache called memoized value.


36) what is error boundaries
    Error Boudaries are React Component which catches JavaScript's Errors and error gets logged when 
    some error occured in components. LifeCycle Methods of Error : i) static getDerivedStateFromError()
    ii)componentDidCatch(error , info)

37) what is forward Refs?
    forward Refs is functionality to get acces of ref in child component.


38) when do we use Class based components?
    before indroduction of hooks, we uses class Bases component to manipulate the state as function 
    based component is like a dummy or presentationl component.

39) Fragement in React?
    Normally React Component only return single element for that we need to wrap the component into 
    single div. But single div takes space which is not needed then here the concept comes empty 
    wrapper which only wrap all element into single element.

40) How to store data in react without api.
    We can use local storage and sessional storage to save data without api.


41) Difference between Context API and useContext?
    normally when we use Context API, there 3 term called context, provider and consumer but because 
    of complex structure of consumer we do use useContext Hook after introduction of hook we use 
    useContext to get data from provider.


42) Local Storage, Session Storage and Coockies?


43) Indexdb, What, why , how, alternatives?


44) what is Context?
    the situation in which somthing gonna happen

45) What is Lazy - Loading?
    Some Time We do have a code which makes our application heavy and in which their time Complexity 
    is high then it takes too much time to load or it is possible that our internet connection is slow,
    in those case we can render other Component which gets easily load in place of that using suspence
    which uses fallback. For lazy loading we have to import lazy and suspence from react.


46) what is suspence?
    suspence is component in which we can pass the component as parameter which gets load while slow 
    loading.    


47) React Code Splitting ?
    It is a concept to split the code in two file. By this we can sperate the lazy loading file and 
    other files.

48) What is Bind Method in JavaScript? Why do we use it in react?
    Bind function allow us to Bind the Object with some other Function, In class based component when 
    we use  

49) What is useHistory in react-router-dom?
    useHistory is a hook which helps us to redirect to previous Page after some perform done. it can 
    be implement using -

    i) import { useHistory } from react-router-dom
    ii) inside of functional component make a const variable like: 

         const history = useHistory() 

    iii) implement useHistory like - 

         onClick={history.goBack()}

Note-1) We can also use push method in place of goBack method to reach on desired Page and here we 
        need to desired Page link like-

       step i) and ii) of above is similar but iii) step got changed by push method like

       onClick = { ()=> history.push("/link_name")}

Note-2) we use useHistory when we need to perform some task before page redirection, if we don't need 
        to perform any other task or calculation we can use link using react-router-dom
    
         
50) we do have location in useHistory but why we do need to use useLocation to get the current path of 
    Page?
 => This is because useHistory is mutuable which means it can be changed so we do use useLocation to 
    get the current Path of Page.

51) What is dependencies and dev dependencies. what is the need of it?


52) difference between hash router and Browser Router?


53) what is useNavigate?
 => useNavigate is a hook in react-router dom it is the alternative of useHistory to go to different 
    page of application

    Example to implement useNavigate is-

   i) first install react-router-dom like

     npm i react-router-dom --save    ||   yarn add react-router-dom
  
   ii) import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

   iii) outside of return do save it, in external variable like-

       const nav = useNavigate();

   iv) implement nav on some action like onClick -

       <button onClick={()=>nav(-1)}>Click</button>

       or

       <button onClick={()=>nav("Route_path_name")}>Click</button>

54) How to redirect to error page if some invalid address got input>

  => we have just write * in place of path like-

      <Route path="*" element={<component_name />} />      

55) what is Index route in react-router-dom?

=>  Index Route is a nested route, Sometime we do need to render a component with the same URL of 
    Parent URL, here we do need to implement Index Route. like=>

    <Route path="link" element={<Parent_Component />}
        <Route Index element={<Component_Name />} />
    </Route>

56) Disadvantages of Prop Drilling in React?

=>  there is a disadvantages of prop drilling which is

    i)  if want to pass the  data between more than two between components then data should be pass
        between all between components which complex of structures which means it will be make hard 
        to understand the code.
    ii) it will makes difficult to manage the code, 
    iii) using prop drilling, we have to pass the data in component where we dont't need it.    

57)  What is Functional Component in React?
=> Functional Component is a plain javascript pure function that accept props as argument and return a
   React element (JSX).

58) What is Class Component in React? 
=> Class Component is a Simple Class that made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the 
   application
